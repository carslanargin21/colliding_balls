# Colliding Balls

This is a MATLAB project simulating the motion and collision of balls within a specified rectangle. The balls are placed randomly in the rectangle, and their collisions follow the laws of physics, specifically Newton's third law and the conservation of momentum.

## Features
- Random placement of balls within a defined rectangular area.
- Ball collisions are simulated using the principles of conservation of momentum.
- Visually demonstrates how objects behave according to Newton's 3rd law of motion.
-
- Some of the code was taken from [1].
